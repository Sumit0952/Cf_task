## 📝 Additional Notes
- Ensure you have installed [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- The project requires `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler`, which are already included in `package.json`.
- If gestures are not working, wrap the root component in `GestureHandlerRootView` in `App.js`.
